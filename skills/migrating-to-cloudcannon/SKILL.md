# Migrating to CloudCannon

This skill orchestrates a full migration of an existing SSG site to CloudCannon. It coordinates five phases, delegating domain-specific work to standalone skills that can also be used independently.

> **Model recommendation:** This migration involves multi-file architectural decisions across five phases. Use a high-reasoning model (not a fast/lightweight one) for best results.

## Supported SSGs

| SSG   | Guide                                  |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Astro | [astro/overview.md](astro/overview.md) |

## Chaining with upstream skills

If the Astro site is being **generated** as part of this task (e.g. converting from WordPress or another platform), read [astro/cc-friendly-conventions.md](astro/cc-friendly-conventions.md) before scaffolding. It summarizes the structural choices that make the CloudCannon migration smooth — output mode, content collection layout, image handling, component framework, and page structure. Following those conventions upfront avoids refactoring work in the migration phases.

Once the site is scaffolded, return here and run the migration phases as normal.

## Step 1: Detect the SSG

Before starting, identify the SSG. Run from the project root:

```bash
npx @cloudcannon/cli configure detect-ssg
```

This returns the detected SSG and confidence scores. Use the result to select the correct SSG guide above.

## Migration phases

Each SSG guide walks through these phases in order with SSG-specific instructions. Phases that delegate to standalone skills are marked below — read the skill when you reach that phase.

1. **Audit** — Analyze the site's content structure, components, routing, and build pipeline before making changes.
2. **Configuration** — Generate and customize CloudCannon config files.
   - **Read the `cloudcannon-configuration` skill** for CloudCannon CLI usage, structures, collection URLs, inputs, and SSG-specific configuration guidance.
   - If the site uses MDX components or inline HTML in content, also **read the `cloudcannon-snippets` skill** for snippet configuration.
3. **Content** — Restructure content files if needed so they're CMS-friendly.
4. **Visual editing** — Add support for CloudCannon's Visual Editor with editable regions.
   - **Read the `cloudcannon-visual-editing` skill** for editable regions API, setup workflow, and SSG-specific patterns.
5. **Build and test** — Validate the migration works end-to-end.

Not every site needs all phases. Small sites may skip Phase 3 if content is already well-structured. Visual editing (Phase 4) is optional but high-value.

### Phase discipline

**Read the phase checklist BEFORE and AFTER each phase.** Every phase doc ends with a verification checklist. Read it before starting the phase so you know what to aim for, then work through every item before marking the phase complete. This is the single most important discipline in the migration — the checklists catch things you will otherwise miss.

Common misses that checklists prevent: data collections missing from `collections_config`, `data_config` entries missing for referenced data files, blog/detail page editables skipped while focusing on page builder blocks, arrays not linked to structures.

**You are not done with a phase until every checklist item is verified.** Don't move on with unchecked items.

**Phases are sequential, not siloed.** When a later-phase concern (e.g. a missing frontmatter field) blocks the current phase from producing the right result, make the targeted fix now rather than settling for a worse outcome. Small, mechanical fixes (adding a missing field, normalizing a value) are fine in any phase. Structural changes (moving files, reorganizing collections, altering rendering) should still wait for their proper phase.

## Scripts

Deterministic migration steps are automated as scripts in [scripts/](scripts/). Run these before or during the relevant phase to save time and repetition.

## Migration notes

Create a `migration/` directory at the project root with one file per phase (`audit.md`, `configuration.md`, `content.md`, `visual-editing.md`, `build.md`). Use these to document decisions, findings, and anything the user should review. The agent writes to them as work progresses; the user can read them to understand what changed and why.

## Handoff and verification

### Testing boundaries (agents vs humans)

- **CloudCannon and the visual editor** — Fidelity checks inside the real product (preview, inline edit, save-to-git) are **human** tasks. Do not assume you can fully replicate CloudCannon in the local environment.
- **After a substantive pass** — Prefer asking the user to run verification (build, CloudCannon) rather than starting a long-lived dev server or heavy end-to-end testing in the agent session.
- **Light automation** — Builds, greps, small scripts, and checks described in SSG phase docs (e.g. inspecting `dist/`) are appropriate; keep them proportional.
- **Deeper agent testing** — When the task truly requires it, more advanced automated checks are fine; keep them proportional to the task.

### When to close with the user

Do this after a **meaningful chunk** of work, not after every tiny edit. At minimum: when **Build and test** is done for a first full migration pass. If the user stops earlier (e.g. after configuration only), hand off at that milestone instead.

### What to say

Be direct and brief: a short summary of what changed, then a **checklist** the user can run, then **one clear ask** for feedback. Skip empty phrases ("let me know if you need anything"). Thanking them once for checking is fine.

### What to ask the user to verify

1. **Local build** — The project's real build entrypoint (usually `npm run build` or whatever `package.json` defines), not a partial command. If it failed, they should paste the **full** error output (or at least the command, exit code, and the last ~30 lines of stderr).
2. **Checks you already ran** — If you ran SSG-specific checks from the build doc (e.g. grep `dist/` for editable attributes), say so in one line so they do not duplicate work.
3. **CloudCannon (human)** — They should confirm in the hosted environment:
   - Inline text regions can be edited in the preview on representative pages
   - Image regions open the image picker
   - Array regions show add/remove/reorder controls where arrays were wired
   - Cross-file editables (`@file`, shared partials, etc.) update the intended source file—not always the page being viewed
   - Saved changes land in the expected files in git

SSG-specific build and `dist/` checks stay in each SSG's build phase doc.

### What to ask the user to send back

So the next turn is actionable, ask for **concrete** signals: the exact command they ran, CloudCannon build log snippets if the remote build failed, the page URL and what they clicked if the editor misbehaved, or a short description of what differs from what they expected.

### Iteration

End with one line that invites the next pass on their reply—for example: when they have run those checks, they should reply with any failures or odd behavior so you can adjust in a follow-up.

## Naming conventions

Follow the project's existing conventions when present. Otherwise:

- `kebab-case` for files
- `camelCase` for JavaScript and JSON
- Markdown frontmatter and YAML: match the existing component prop names so frontmatter keys pass through without translation. When creating new fields with no existing convention, prefer `snake_case`.

## Common mistakes

| "I'll call the homepage file `home.md` — it's more descriptive" | CloudCannon resolves the URL from the slug; `home.md` with `url: "/[slug]/"` → `/home/`.

| "It's hardcoded, so it's developer-only"                        | If an editor can see it on the page, they must be able to edit it.

| "This page is unique so it should be source-editable"           | Unique-layout pages with 2+ sections belong in a `pages` collection with a page-builder schema.

| "I'll make a single-entry `homepage` collection"                | Use one `pages` collection with `index.md` as one entry. Add `our-team.md`, `about.md`, etc. as more entries. CloudCannon collections support multiple schemas per collection -- both via `schemas:` config and via Zod `z.union` in Astro content config. See [../cloudcannon-configuration/astro/configuration.md § Schemas](../cloudcannon-configuration/astro/configuration.md#schemas).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| "Page builder is overkill for these few pages"                  | Page builder is the default for any site with more than one unique-layout page. The cost is a `[...slug].astro` catch-all + a `BlockRenderer` -- both are mechanical. The benefit is editors can add new pages without engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
